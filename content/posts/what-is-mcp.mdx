## The Problem

Every AI assistant has the same limitation: it can only work with what's in its context window. Need it to check your calendar? Query a database? Read a file? Each integration requires custom code, bespoke APIs, and fragile glue logic.

It's 2026 and we're still building one-off integrations like it's 2015.

## The Solution

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that gives AI models a universal way to connect to external tools and data.

Think of it like USB for AI. Before USB, every device needed its own connector. MCP does the same thing for AI integrations — one protocol, infinite connections.

## How It Works

MCP uses a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Hosts** are AI applications (Claude Desktop, an IDE, your custom agent)
- **MCP Clients** maintain connections between hosts and servers
- **MCP Servers** expose tools, resources, and data through a standard interface

When Claude needs to read a file or call an API, it communicates through MCP rather than needing custom integration code.

```
Your AI ←→ MCP Client ←→ MCP Server ←→ External Service
```

Build one MCP server for your service. Every MCP-compatible AI can use it.

## What Can MCP Do?

The ecosystem is growing fast. There are MCP servers for:

- **File systems** — read and write local files
- **Databases** — PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB
- **APIs** — GitHub, Slack, Linear, Notion, dozens more
- **Browser automation** — control Chrome programmatically
- **Dev tools** — run tests, lint code, manage deployments

If there's a service you use, someone's probably building an MCP server for it.

## Why This Matters

**For developers:** Instead of building custom integrations for each AI tool, build one MCP server. It works with Claude, GPT, and any other compatible model.

**For users:** Your AI can actually *do* things — not just talk about them. Check email, update spreadsheets, deploy code, manage your calendar. All through natural conversation.

**For the ecosystem:** Open standards prevent lock-in. Your MCP servers work everywhere. Competition happens on model quality, not integration monopolies.

## The Anthropic Connection

MCP was created by Anthropic, but it's open source and model-agnostic. You can use it with any AI system. Anthropic open-sourced it specifically to avoid fragmentation — they'd rather have a shared standard than a proprietary advantage.

That's notable. In a world of AI companies hoarding everything, Anthropic gave this away.

## What MCP Doesn't Do

MCP isn't magic. It doesn't make integrations secure by itself. It doesn't prevent misuse. It doesn't guarantee that every MCP server is well-built.

It's plumbing. Good plumbing enables good applications, but you still have to build the applications.

Also, MCP is for tools and data, not for the models themselves. It's about what AI can *access*, not how AI *thinks*.

## Where This Is Going

MCP is becoming the default. Major AI companies are adopting it. The server ecosystem is exploding. Within a year, "does it have an MCP server?" will be a standard question for any service.

We're moving toward a world where AI can seamlessly interact with any digital system — the same way your computer can connect to any USB device without thinking about drivers.

That world is closer than most people realize. MCP is how we get there.
