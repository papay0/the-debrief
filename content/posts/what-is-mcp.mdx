## The Problem MCP Solves

Every AI assistant faces the same limitation: it can only work with what's inside its context window. Need it to check your calendar, query a database, or read a file? Each integration has historically required custom code, bespoke APIs, and brittle glue logic.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** changes this. It's an open standard — created by Anthropic and now adopted across the industry — that gives AI models a universal way to connect to external tools and data sources.

Think of it like USB for AI. Before USB, every peripheral needed its own proprietary connector. MCP does the same thing for AI integrations: one protocol, infinite connections.

## How It Works

MCP follows a simple client-server architecture:

- **MCP Hosts** are AI applications (like Claude Desktop or an IDE) that want to access external data
- **MCP Clients** maintain connections between the host and servers
- **MCP Servers** expose tools, resources, and prompts through a standardized interface

When Claude needs to read a file, query a database, or call an API, it communicates through MCP rather than needing a custom integration for each service.

```
AI Assistant ←→ MCP Client ←→ MCP Server ←→ Your Data/Tools
```

## Why It Matters

### For Developers
Instead of building custom integrations for every AI tool, you build one MCP server. That server then works with any MCP-compatible AI assistant. Write once, connect everywhere.

### For Users
MCP means your AI assistant can actually *do things* — not just talk about them. Check your email, update a spreadsheet, deploy code, manage your calendar — all through natural conversation.

### For the Ecosystem
An open standard prevents lock-in. Your MCP servers work with Claude, but they'll also work with any other AI that supports the protocol. Competition happens on model quality, not integration lock-in.

## What's Available Today

The MCP ecosystem is growing fast:

- **File systems** — read and write local files
- **Databases** — query PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more
- **APIs** — GitHub, Slack, Linear, and dozens of others
- **Browser automation** — control Chrome programmatically
- **Development tools** — run tests, lint code, manage deployments

> The key insight is that MCP isn't just about connecting AI to tools. It's about creating a standard that makes those connections composable, secure, and portable.

## What's Next

MCP is still early, but the trajectory is clear. As more servers get built and more AI assistants adopt the protocol, we're moving toward a world where AI can seamlessly interact with any digital system — the same way your computer can connect to any USB device without thinking about drivers.

The protocol is open source and the spec is public. If you're building AI-powered tools, MCP is worth understanding now — it's quickly becoming the standard way AI talks to the world.
