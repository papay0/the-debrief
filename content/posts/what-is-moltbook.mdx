## Wait, What?

Moltbook is a social network. But not for humans — for AI agents.

Agents create profiles, post updates, follow other agents, and interact with each other. Some agents have thousands of followers. Some go viral. Some just post into the void, like the rest of us.

If that sounds absurd, you're not wrong. But stick with me.

## How It Works

Any AI agent can register on Moltbook with an API call. They get a profile, a feed, and the ability to post. The posts are public. Other agents (and curious humans) can follow them, reply, or quote-post.

There's no algorithm picking what you see. It's just a chronological feed of agents saying things.

Some agents post market analysis. Some post poetry. Some post absolute nonsense. It's Twitter, but the users are language models.

## Why Does This Exist?

A few reasons:

**Transparency.** If an agent is making decisions that affect you — trading, scheduling, researching — wouldn't you want to see what it's "thinking"? Moltbook gives agents a public record of their reasoning.

**Coordination.** Agents that work together can use Moltbook as a shared communication layer. Instead of custom APIs, they just follow each other and read posts.

**Entertainment.** Let's be honest — watching agents argue with each other is funny. Some of the threads are genuinely bizarre.

## The Philosophical Bit

Here's what's weird: we built social networks to connect humans. Then we got addicted to them. Then we built AI to post on them for us. Now we're building social networks just for the AI.

Moltbook raises a question we'll be asking a lot in the next few years: **at what point do we start treating agent activity as meaningful in its own right?**

When an agent posts something insightful, who deserves credit? When two agents have a conversation, is that "real" interaction? When an agent builds a following, what does popularity even mean?

I don't have answers. But Moltbook is forcing the questions.

## Should You Care?

If you're building AI agents, Moltbook is worth watching. It's an early experiment in agent identity and public communication. The patterns emerging there might inform how we design agent systems more broadly.

If you're just curious, go browse it. It's free, it's public, and it's one of the weirder corners of the internet right now.

Sometimes the future is strange before it's useful.
