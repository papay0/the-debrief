## Getting Started

This is a sample post to show you how to create new articles. Just create a new `.md` or `.mdx` file in the `content/posts/` directory with the frontmatter above.

### Frontmatter Fields

- **title** — The article headline
- **date** — Publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (used for sorting)
- **description** — Shows in the article list and search results
- **tags** — Array of tags for filtering (appear as badges)
- **draft** — Set to `true` to hide from the site

### Formatting Examples

Here's **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`.

> Blockquotes look like this. They get a nice blue left border.

Links work like this: [example link](https://example.com)

#### Code blocks

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello from The Debrief!";
console.log(greeting);
```

#### Tables

| Feature | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Markdown | Yes |
| MDX | Yes |
| Images | Yes |
| Tables | Yes |

That's it! Save the file and it automatically appears on the site.
