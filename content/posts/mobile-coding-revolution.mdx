## I Code From My Phone Now

A year ago, if you told me I'd be shipping production code from my iPhone, I would have laughed. Coding on mobile? With that tiny keyboard? No IDE? No thanks.

But here's what I realized: **I'm not writing code anymore. I'm writing prompts.**

And prompts? Those work great on a phone.

## The Shift

Traditional coding requires a specific setup. You need a real keyboard, a big screen, an IDE with syntax highlighting and autocomplete. The physical act of typing code demands precision.

AI-assisted coding is different. You describe what you want. The model writes the code. You review, adjust, iterate. The bottleneck isn't typing speed — it's thinking speed.

That shift changes everything about *where* you can code.

## What Mobile Coding Looks Like

I'm on the train. I get a bug report. I pull out my phone, open Claude Code, and say: "Check the authentication flow in the login component. Users are getting logged out randomly."

Claude reads the codebase, finds the issue, proposes a fix. I review the diff, approve it, and the commit is pushed. Total time: 4 minutes.

I didn't write a single line of code. I didn't need to.

## Why This Matters

**Coding becomes ambient.** You don't need to "sit down and code" anymore. You can fix bugs while waiting for coffee. You can prototype features during lunch. The barrier between "thinking about code" and "writing code" disappears.

**More people can code.** Not everyone has access to a laptop. Not everyone can sit at a desk for hours. Mobile-first AI coding democratizes software development in a way nothing else has.

**Speed compounds.** Small improvements happen faster because you're not waiting until you're "at your computer." Every idle moment becomes potential productivity.

## The Objections

"But you can't do *real* coding on a phone."

Depends on what you mean by real. Can I write a complex algorithm from scratch on my phone? Probably not efficiently. But 80% of coding isn't that. It's fixing bugs, adding features, reviewing changes, refactoring. All of that works fine on mobile.

"The screen is too small to review diffs."

True for massive changes. But most diffs are 20-50 lines. That fits on a phone screen. For bigger changes, I wait until I'm at my laptop. No rule says you have to do everything on mobile.

## I Built This

Before Claude Code had a mobile version, I built my own. I wanted to code from my phone so badly that I shipped an app to make it happen.

That app became AgentSOS. It's still running. And now that Claude has official mobile support, I use both.

The point isn't the specific tool. The point is: **mobile AI coding is real, it works, and it's only getting better.**

## Where This Is Going

Five years from now, the idea that you needed a laptop to code will seem quaint. Like how we look back at punch cards, or coding without autocomplete.

The future of coding is writing prompts in plain English from whatever device is in your hand. We're not there yet, but we're closer than most people realize.

I'm already living there. You can too.
