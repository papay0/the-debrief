## The Buzzword Problem

"Agent" is everywhere. Every AI company claims to have agents. Every startup is building agent infrastructure. Every demo shows autonomous AI doing impressive things.

But ask five people what an AI agent is and you'll get six different answers.

Let's fix that.

## A Simple Definition

An AI agent is a system that can **take actions autonomously** to achieve a goal.

That's it. The key word is *actions*. A chatbot answers questions. An agent does things.

- Chatbot: "Here's how you could fix that bug."
- Agent: *fixes the bug*

The difference isn't intelligence. It's agency — the ability to act in the world, not just describe what actions to take.

## The Spectrum

Agents exist on a spectrum of autonomy:

**Low autonomy:** The AI suggests actions, you approve each one. "Should I send this email?" Click yes.

**Medium autonomy:** The AI takes routine actions automatically but asks for approval on anything significant. Most useful agents today live here.

**High autonomy:** The AI pursues goals independently, making decisions without checking in. This is where things get interesting — and risky.

Most practical agents in 2026 are in the low-to-medium range. High autonomy sounds cool in demos but usually causes problems in practice.

## What Makes an Agent Work?

Three components:

**1. A model that can reason.** The core intelligence. Claude, GPT, Gemini — whatever can understand goals and plan actions.

**2. Tools to take actions.** File access, API calls, browser control, terminal commands. Without tools, an agent is just a chatbot with ambition.

**3. Memory and context.** Agents need to remember what they've done, what worked, what didn't. Otherwise every task starts from scratch.

Put these together and you get something that can actually accomplish goals, not just talk about them.

## Why Now?

Agents aren't new in concept. We've had automation for decades. What's new is that language models can now:

- Understand ambiguous goals expressed in natural language
- Break complex tasks into steps dynamically
- Use general-purpose tools without custom programming
- Learn from mistakes within a session

This makes agents accessible. You don't need to program exact behaviors. You describe what you want and the agent figures out how.

## The Confusion

People use "agent" to mean very different things:

- A chatbot with a persona ("my sales agent")
- An automation script with an LLM wrapper
- A fully autonomous system that operates independently
- A research prototype that mostly doesn't work yet

All of these get called agents. This makes the term almost meaningless.

My suggestion: focus on **what the system can actually do**, not what it's called. Can it take real actions? Does it work without supervision? How much can you trust it?

Those questions matter more than labels.

## Why This Matters

Agents are the next interface. Not chat, not apps — agents that do things on your behalf.

This changes how we interact with computers. Instead of learning software, you tell an agent what you want. Instead of managing tools, you delegate to systems that manage themselves.

We're early. Most agents are unreliable. The tooling is immature. The security models are sketchy.

But the trajectory is clear. Agents are coming. Understanding what they actually are — beyond the buzzword — is the first step to using them well.
