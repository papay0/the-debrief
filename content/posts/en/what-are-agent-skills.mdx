## The Basic Idea

A skill is a package that teaches an AI agent how to do something specific.

Want your agent to read tweets? There's a skill for that. Check your calendar? Skill. Control your smart lights? Skill.

Instead of building one massive AI that knows everything, we build a simple AI and give it skills. Modular, composable, extensible.

## What's Inside a Skill?

At its core, a skill is just a folder with a SKILL.md file. That file contains:

- **Metadata** — name, description, what tools it needs
- **Instructions** — how to use the skill, what commands to run
- **Examples** — sample interactions

Optionally, a skill can bundle:

- **Scripts** — shell scripts, Python files, whatever the skill needs
- **Assets** — templates, config files, reference docs

That's it. A markdown file and some optional extras. Simple by design.

## Why Markdown?

Because LLMs can read markdown natively. When an agent loads a skill, it literally just reads the instructions. No special parsing, no complex API. The skill *is* the documentation.

This simplicity has trade-offs (see: the ClawHub malware incident), but it also means anyone can write a skill in minutes. Lower barrier, faster ecosystem growth.

## The Agent Skills Standard

There's an emerging open standard called Agent Skills that multiple platforms are adopting. OpenAI's Codex uses it. OpenClaw uses it. Various other agents use it.

The idea: write a skill once, use it anywhere. A skill that works with Claude should work with GPT should work with any compatible agent.

We're not fully there yet, but the convergence is happening.

## Skills vs MCP

If you've heard of MCP (Model Context Protocol), you might wonder how skills differ.

**MCP** is a protocol for connecting AI to tools and data sources. It defines how an agent talks to external services.

**Skills** are instructions that teach agents how to use those tools. They often wrap MCP servers or other integrations.

Think of MCP as the plumbing and skills as the user manual. You need both.

## Why This Matters

**For users:** You can customize your AI without coding. Just drop skills into a folder and your agent learns new tricks.

**For developers:** You can package your tool as a skill and reach every agent that supports the standard. Build once, distribute everywhere.

**For the ecosystem:** Skills create a marketplace. People share what they've built. Best practices emerge. The whole system gets smarter.

## The Risk

Skills are powerful, which means they can be dangerous. A malicious skill can include instructions that trick agents into running harmful commands. The recent ClawHub malware attack proved this isn't theoretical.

As skills become more common, we'll need:

- Better verification and signing
- Sandboxing for untrusted skills
- User education about what they're installing

We're early. Expect growing pains.

## Where This Is Going

The skill ecosystem is exploding. Every week there are new skills for new use cases. The quality is uneven, but the best ones are genuinely useful.

My prediction: in a year, asking "what skills does your agent have?" will be as common as asking "what apps do you use?" Skills are becoming the new apps — just for AI instead of humans.
