## The Short Version

Claude Code is an AI tool that writes code for you. You describe what you want in plain English, and it builds it. Not just a line or two. Entire features, bug fixes, full workflows.

It's made by Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude. And it's growing faster than almost any software product in history.

## What It Actually Does

Imagine you have a junior developer who never sleeps, knows every programming language, and can read your entire codebase in seconds. That's Claude Code.

You open your terminal (the text-based interface developers use to talk to their computers) and type something like: "Fix the bug where users get logged out randomly." Claude Code reads the relevant files, finds the problem, writes the fix, runs tests to make sure nothing else broke, and saves the changes. You review what it did and approve it.

No typing code. No staring at error messages for hours. You describe the problem, it handles the rest.

## Who Made It

Anthropic is an AI safety company founded by Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI. The company is focused on building AI that's powerful but also safe and controllable.

Claude Code was created by Boris Cherny, a staff engineer at Anthropic. It started as a simple research project in February 2025. A terminal tool that could chat about code and make small edits. Nothing revolutionary at first glance.

Then it got good. Really good.

## Why It's a Big Deal

The numbers tell the story.

**$1 billion in annual revenue in six months.** Claude Code launched publicly in May 2025. By November, it hit a billion-dollar run rate. For context, ChatGPT (the fastest-growing consumer app ever at the time) took longer to reach that milestone.

**4% of all public code on GitHub is now written by Claude Code.** That's over 135,000 contributions per day, according to a recent SemiAnalysis report. They project that number will hit 20% by the end of 2026.

**Companies are all in.** Notion, Uber, Plaid, Zapier, and hundreds of others use it daily. Notion's co-founder said his job is now "keeping as many instances of Claude Code busy as possible."

## How It's Different

You've probably heard of GitHub Copilot or Cursor. Those are AI tools that help you write code inside a text editor. Think of them as really smart autocomplete.

Claude Code is different. It doesn't just suggest the next line. It acts. It reads your whole project, plans what needs to happen, makes changes across multiple files, runs your tests, and fixes its own mistakes. It's the difference between a spell-checker and someone who rewrites your essay for you.

The technical term for this is "agentic." It doesn't wait for instructions at every step. You give it a goal, and it figures out how to get there.

## What Just Happened

On February 5, 2026, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.6, the latest model powering Claude Code. It introduced something called Agent Teams, where multiple AI agents work together on the same project, splitting up tasks and checking each other's work.

It also expanded the amount of information Claude Code can process at once (its "context window") to one million tokens. In simple terms, it can now understand and work with much larger codebases than before.

## The Bigger Question

Claude Code isn't just a faster way to write software. It's changing *who* can build software and *how*.

If you can describe what you want in plain English, you can build it. You don't need years of training. You don't need to memorize programming languages. You need clarity about what you want to create.

That's a fundamental shift. And it's happening right now, not five years from now.

We're still in the early chapters. But the trajectory is clear. The tool that writes 4% of the world's code today is only getting better.

Pay attention to this one.
