# The Debrief

## Writing style

- Articles are written for non-technical people. Avoid jargon, developer-specific terms, and code references.
- Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend who doesn't work in tech.
- Use the same conversational tone as the existing articles (short sentences, direct, casual).
- Don't use em-dashes (—). Use periods, commas, or parentheses instead.
- Most readers don't have any of the tools mentioned installed. Keep advice general and accessible.
