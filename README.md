**AI news, explained simply.**

AI moves fast. Every week brings a new model, a new benchmark, a new claim that changes everything.

Most coverage assumes you already know what a transformer is, what RLHF means, or why a new context window matters. **The Debrief doesn't.**

We take the biggest stories in AI and break them down — clearly, honestly, without the hype. Whether you're a developer trying to keep up, a founder evaluating tools, or just someone curious about where this is all heading, this is your weekly read.
